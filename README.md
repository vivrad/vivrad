- 👋 Hi, I’m @vivrad
- 👀 I’m interested in automation. Any form, any size. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects, ideally with a lens towards mobile dev (no reason, just because I haven't done as much as I would like) but honestly could be anything really.
- 📫 How to reach me - Drop me a note at viv.rad@gmail.com and I'll get back to you
